# Orbis Chat

Orbis Chat allows you to create an AI Avatar with custom training data and your voice model (using Elevenlabs).  Speak with users in the live chat using Orbis, then navigate to their user profile at any time to speak to their AI Avatar and learn more about their skills, preferences, or whatever else they may have uploaded.
